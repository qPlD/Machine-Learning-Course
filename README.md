# Machine-Learning-Course

## Introduction 
This coursework is a group project (2 members) for a Kaggle competition.

The coursework consists of two tasks:
1. regression
2. classification

You are asked to construct 2 algorithms for each task. That is 4 algorithms in total.
You are encouraged to write your own code, but use of 3rd party implementations is allowed, as long as you demonstrate an understanding of the algorithms in the accompanying report.

## Kaggle Instructions
For each task, there is a Kaggle page where you can download your training set and testing set.  
You should submit your answers to each Kaggle page following the description. 
For both tasks, you should rely on the training data to compare methods. You can use the feedback from Kaggle to refine your algorithms. 
Each group is allowed to submit 8 times a day for each task. Use your submissions wisely.
By the end of the competition on Kaggle, each group can select two best results for each task.
